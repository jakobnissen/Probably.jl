Similar to bloom filters in structure, they exhibit false positives (may overcount), but no false negatives (never undercounts). Count-min sketches have two parameters: Length and width. Its accuracy is described by two numbers: ϵ describing its error and δ describing its probability of error. More rigorously, if N is the true count of an event, E is the estimate given by a sketch and T the total count of items in the sketch, E ≤ N + Tϵ with probability (1 - δ).
