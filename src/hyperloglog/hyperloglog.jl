# Principle:
# When observing N distinct uniformly distributed integers, the expected maximal
# number of leading zeros in the integers is log(2, N), with large variation.
# To cut variation, we keep 2^P counters, each keeping track of N/2^P
# observations. The estimated N for each counter is averaged using harmonic mean.
# Last, corrections for systematic bias are added, one multiplicative and one
# additive factor.
# To make the observations uniformly distributed integers, we hash them.

    HyperLogLog{P}()

Construct a HyperLogLog cardinality counter. Hashable values can be added to the
counter, and an approximate count of distinct elements (cardinality) retrieved.
The counter has an error of < 2.5% w. 99% probability and median error of 0.5%,
but is only accurate for 2^10 < cardinality < 2^62.

An HyperLogLog{P} consumes 2^P bytes of memory. I recommend P = 14 (using 16 KiB).

# Examples
```
julia> hll = HyperLogLog{14}();

julia> for i in 1:1<<28 push!(hll, i) end

julia> length(hll)
271035100

julia> empty!(hll);
